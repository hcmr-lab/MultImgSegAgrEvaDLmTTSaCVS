[MultImgSegAgrEvaDLmTTSaCVS] Multispectral Image Segmentation in Agriculture: Evaluating Deep Learning Models with Train-Test Split and Cross-Validation Strategies

This repository contains the code implementation for the paper titled **"Multispectral Image Segmentation in Agriculture: Evaluating Deep Learning Models with Train-Test Split and Cross-Validation Strategies"**, which was submitted to the ROBOT 24 Conference. 

The goal of this project is to evaluate the impact of different deep learning models and evaluation protocols on multispectral datasets collected by a UAV over vineyards in Portugal.
